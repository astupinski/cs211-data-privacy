Whenever you see a call to this function, you should replace it with code you have written. Please make sure all cells of your notebook run without error before submitting the assignment. If you have not completed all the questions, leave calls to `your_code_here()` in place or insert dummy values so that the cell does not throw an error when it runs.\n",

You can refer to these example results by viewing the notebook on Github. If you re-run the cell after downloading the notebook, the results will disappear (because the notebook no longer contains the code that generated them). Your solutions should produce results similar to the ones in the uploaded notebook.\n",
