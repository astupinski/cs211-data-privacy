Whenever you see a call to this function, you should replace it with code you have written. Please make sure all cells of your notebook run without error before submitting the assignment. If you have not completed all the questions, leave calls to `your_code_here()` in place or insert dummy values so that the cell does not throw an error when it runs.\n",

Your solutions should produce results similar to the ones in the uploaded notebook.\n",
