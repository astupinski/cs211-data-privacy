# Installing Jupyter Notebook

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

First, install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes
Jupyter Notebook.

Here are links to the installation instructions for different
operating systems:

- [Click here for Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
- [Click here for MacOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/#using-the-command-line-install) - make sure to use the *command line installer*
- [Click here for Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)

The Anaconda package includes Jupyter Notebook.

## Step 2: Verify Anaconda

Check that you can run the `conda` command, to verify that Anaconda
was installed successfully.

- On Windows: Launch the "Anaconda Prompt" program from the start
  menu. Run the command `conda list`. The command should display a
  list of the installed packages.
  
- On MacOS: Launch a terminal. Run the command `conda list`. The
  command should display a list of the installed packages.

- On Linux: Launch a terminal. Run the command `conda list`. The
  command should display a list of the installed packages.

  menu and run the command `jupyter notebook`
